Now's a good time to catch up!). Modifying your Caesar function to encrypt a message for the Affine cipher should only involve taking in another parameter (for the multiplicative key) and then using that key with some multiplication inside the encryption loop. You don't need to have the function decipher messages for this activity, but you *could* think about how you'd do that.
