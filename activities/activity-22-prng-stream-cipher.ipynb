    "In **Activity 22: Introduction to Stream Ciphers**, you saw how you could use ASCII to convert a keyword and plaintext into a stream of binary that could be XOR'd to produce binary ciphertext. In an ideal environment, the keystream would not be based on a word that could be guessed, but rather contain a truly random sequence of 1's and 0's. Since true randomness is essentially impossible to capture, and even if it was, it would be actually impossible to ensure that both the sending and receiving parties had access to the same stream to encrypt and decrypt the message. After all, if you had a way to securely send over the random stream of 1's and 0's that was unique to each message so the receiver could use it, then why bother with encryption in the first place? Just send the message in the same fashion that you are sending the keystream! \n",
